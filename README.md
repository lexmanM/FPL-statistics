# FPL-statistics

The Fantasy Premier League API has loads of data that can be the bedrock for statistical explorations. 

I am currently working on the following (and you can find relevant codes & resources here), 

- Can we predict rank movements based on an user's gw performance?
- How are the users distributed globally? Which club has the most supporters among the FPL users?
